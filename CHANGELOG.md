# Changelog

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

First packaged developer preview of the Rust/PostgreSQL recording workflow:
continuous chunk ingestion, transactional checkpoints and replay, Parquet import,
stored-interval search, overlap suppression, raw interval reconstruction and a
thin Python client. Includes numerical fixtures, SQL contracts, recovery tests,
synthetic benchmarks and a limited CWRU relevance baseline.

Linux amd64 / PostgreSQL 17 only. Fresh installations; no upgrade migration.
Exact synchronous retrieval and extraction. Morlet differentiation and production
capacity remain unproven. See SUPPORT.md and evaluation/README.md.
